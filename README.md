# EM-tree-data-plotting
Coded by Attapun Anivat (attapun-an) | 2020-11-13 | attapunanivat@gmail.com

Graphing the biomass of trees within each plot as a barplot (to show biomass per hectare) and violin plot (distribution of biomass within each plot) 



Data from SK and SG plots were not collected by or owned by the programmer (was collected by different people as part of a group project), and was put here for the purpose of allowing the code to work/transparency. I do not own the rights to the data.
